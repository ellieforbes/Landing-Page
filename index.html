        Ice dance (sometimes referred to as ice dancing) is a discipline of
        figure skating that historically draws from ballroom dancing. It joined
        the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952, and became a Winter
        Olympic Games medal sport in 1976. According to the International
        Skating Union (ISU), the governing body of figure skating, an ice dance
        team consists of one woman and one man. Ice dance, like pair skating,
        has its roots in the "combined skating" developed in the 19th century by
        skating clubs and organizations and in recreational social skating.
        Couples and friends would skate waltzes, marches, and other social
        dances. The first steps in ice dance were similar to those used in
        ballroom dancing
